This Folder contains the report, excel sheets, and source code for our project.
* Testing Run Times is the spreadsheet with all the testing
* CSCI 115 Sorting Algorithms Report is the report with all our findings and analysis
*.cpp file is commented out because of compiler error in Code Blocks, all source code is in header file*
* Due to recursion depth, some sizes for Quick sort and Merge sort will crash due to stack overflow.

To run and test our code:
1. Uncomment the size you want in main function inside of for loop
2. Uncomment the type of array you want in main function inside of for loop
3. Uncomment which sort you want in main function inside of for loop
